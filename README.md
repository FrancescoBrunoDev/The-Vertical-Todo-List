## Inspiration

The vertical design of this todo list was inspired by a cool vertical todo list I saw at a friend's house. It had a rolled-up paper look that was both unique and practical. I wanted to bring that same vertical layout and organized feel into this digital version. I think this design can help you tackle tasks in chronological order and stay more focused.
